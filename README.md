# Fish Image Classification with Deep Learning

Problem Statement

This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using deep learning models. The task involves training a CNN from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models to enhance performance. The project also includes saving models for later use and deploying a Streamlit application to predict fish categories from user-uploaded images.

üéØ Business Use Cases

Enhanced Accuracy: Determine the best model architecture for fish image classification.

Deployment Ready: Create a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions.

Model Comparison: Evaluate and compare metrics across models to select the most suitable approach.

üî¨ Approach

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Rescale images to the [0,1] range.
Apply data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping to enhance model robustness.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training

Train a CNN model from scratch.
Experiment with five pre-trained models:

VGG16
ResNet50
MobileNet
InceptionV3
EfficientNetB0

Fine-tune the pre-trained models on the fish dataset.
Save the trained model (best accuracy) in .h5 or .pkl format for future use.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Compare metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix across all models.
Visualize training history (accuracy and loss) for each model.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

Build a Streamlit application to:
Allow users to upload fish images.
Predict and display the fish category.
Provide model confidence scores.

üöÄ Installation & Usage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

üìä Results & Findings

The best model achieved an accuracy of 98.74% (MobileNet) on the test dataset.
Transfer learning models outperformed the CNN trained from scratch.
The final model was deployed as a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
